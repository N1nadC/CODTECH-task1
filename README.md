Overview
This project implements a linear regression model to predict housing prices using the California Housing dataset. The model leverages key features such as total rooms, total bedrooms, housing median age, and ocean proximity to make accurate predictions. The dataset provides valuable insights into housing characteristics in California, with the goal of estimating the median house value based on the specified attributes. The project showcases essential data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, feature selection, and data transformation, followed by model training and evaluation using common regression metrics.
